# strava-aggregator

THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS

To get a list of all .fit files that take place within 20 kilometers of MIT:
- Run `python setup.py` and enter the path to the Strava export activities folder
- Run `python unzip_fit_files.py`
- Run `python filter_fit_files.py`. This should print out a list of fit files.
